Idea resource
-----------

This idea is from a website called 115.com, which can let 9 websites' account to login on their service.

And it can let people to combine multi account in one 115 account.

I think if we combine all the api together to make an ARIA account. It would let more developer to develop more auth apps.

Doing Steps
----------

1.	Basic Devise system working and setting interface.
2.	OmniAuth on google(+), facebook, plurk, twitter....
3.	Combine Auth in one account.
4.	Set the api for service using.
5.	Set the manager to manage auth provide.
